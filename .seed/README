sow-basic-ruby(1) - create a basic Ruby project layout
======================================================

## SYNOPSIS

  `sow basic.ruby <name>`

## DESCRIPTION

Traditional Ruby project scaffolding. This provides the common structure
for a standard Ruby project. This seed takes a single argument for the
project's name. The name must a single alphanumeric word --what is often
called a "unixname". If the name is not given the basename of the destination
directory will be used.

### HISTORY.md

Keep a running list of changes by version and date in HISTORY.md file.
These entries serve as Release Notice and ChangeLog, the release text
also makes for a propert tag message when tagging releases. It's better
to keep a manual log, rather then use the log generated by the SCM because
the SCM log will have gritty details with which end-users will not be concerned.
